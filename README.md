# Expansion

This is a repository to accompany a research paper, currently under review. 

There are two folders, the first of which contains supplementary plots and the second one stores data and analysis code in R.

	Supplementary_plots
	
	Data_and_analysis_code
	
The analysis folder is further divided into four folders, containing experiments with fossil data, present day data, taphonomic simulations as well as toy examples.
