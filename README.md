# Expansion

This is a repository to accompany a research paper, currently under review. 

There are three folders, the first two contain supplementary plots and tables, the last one stores data and analysis code in R.

	Supplementary_plots
	
	Supplementary_tables
	
	Data_and_analysis_code
	
The supplementary folders contain labelled subfolders, corresponding to different analytical questions (laws, relationships to body mass) and whether the analysis is at the species or at the genus level. 

The data and analysis folder is further divided into four folders, containing experiments with fossil data, present day data, taphonomic simulations as well as toy examples. The instructions for running the code currently are not very detailed, but hopefully sufficient to assess the study during the review process.
